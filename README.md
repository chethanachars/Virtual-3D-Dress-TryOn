# Virtual-3D-Dress-TryOn
This project is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application developed using Tkinter and the M3D-VTON (Monocular-to-3D Virtual Try-On Network). The application allows users to virtually try on dresses in a 3D environment. MeshLab is required to visualize the output, and the generated measurements are displayed after the virtual try-on.
